DC motors are an integral part of competition robotics, and proper motor selection is essential to successful robot design. FIRST competitions have limits on which motors may be used and how many (FRC Rule R29). Consult the game manual each year to insure the motors and specific part numbers are permitted.

To help select proper motors for mechanisms, a table with specifications of popular motors is below. This table contains mostly experimental data from VEX, which can be found [here](http://motors.vex.com/#testing). VEX Robotics motor curves were developed experimentally using a "down-up" dyno test, an industry-standard measurement system which helps to correct for rotational inertia. This data is more useful for comparison than nominal specifications due to its common method of measurement.

## Key Characteristics of DC Motors

Four key characteristics are used to define a motor's performance. When designing a mechanism, all tradeoffs must be considered for the particular application.

* **Free Speed** (RPM) – The maximum speed at which a motor will rotate when under no load
* **Free Current** (A) – The minimum current a motor will draw when under no load
* **Stall Torque** (Nm) – The amount of load placed on a motor that will cause it to stall (stop moving)
* **Stall Current** (A) – The amount of current drawn by a motor when it is stalled

Under no load, "free", a motor spins at its **free speed** and draws a **free current**. Conversely, **stall torque** and **stall current** represent a motor being worked to its maximum, or "stalled", to the point at which it can no longer move.

These characteristics represent the theoretical minimum and maximum conditions for a motor.

Motors generally should not be run at these edge conditions, so usage in mechanisms should be optimized somewhere in the middle. Holding a load at stall will quickly destroy a motor, especially those with small thermal mass (meaning small capacity to store or redirect heat). Very little work can be done at free speeds, since zero torque occurs at maximum speed.

## Direct Comparison

For comparison purposes, it is useful to consider torque when 80% operating speed is reduced to 200 rpm output speed. Typical DC motor efficiency is highest near this range.

### Ancillary Motors
All automotive throttle control, window, door, windshield wiper, and seat motors are normally legal. Integrating these into standard robot gearboxes or shafts can be challenging. However there an enormous number of potential solutions in this huge range of options.

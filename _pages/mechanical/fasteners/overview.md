## Materials

Fasteners are available in a huge variety of materials, including steel, stainless steel, bronze, brass, and aluminum.

Alloy steel fasteners are made from high-strength, heat-treated steel. They are not plated and normally have a dull black finish.

Carbon steel fasteners are the most common and come with various surface treatments (zinc plating, galvanization, chrome plating). Carbon steel fasteners are sold in different grade ratings to indicate their strength.

Stainless steel fasteners are non-magnetic, but are otherwise more expensive (grades 18-8, 316 and 410).

Since steel is generally stronger and more widely available, there is very little use for bronze, brass, or aluminum fasteners in FRC. However, aluminum is a common material for rivets.

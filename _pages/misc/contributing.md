Having trouble understanding something? Found a typo in the content? Interested in adding information or helping to [clarify a section](https://github.com/FRCDoneRight/FIRSTCompendium/issues)? Then by all means [submit an issue](https://github.com/FRCDoneRight/FIRSTCompendium/issues/new) or [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) first.

The FIRST Compendium has been designed as an all-encompassing resource to help create and grow FIRST teams from all levels of play. Please keep this in mind when requesting features and/or submitting pull requests. Most anything is welcome, but if it's not something useful to more than one team it will not be accepted. When in doubt, please ask!

## Content Additions

If you aren't comfortable with the text format that FIRST Compendium uses, or don't know how to use Github, you can still contribute content! You simply need to create a Github account and open an issue at https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/issues with a short description and a link to your content.

## Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a branch off of `master` and give it a meaningful name (e.g. `my-awesome-new-page`) and describe the feature or fix.
3. Open a pull request on GitHub.

All source files for pages can be found in the [`/_pages`](https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/blob/master/_pages) folder if you'd like to tackle any "low-hanging fruit" like fixing typos, bad grammar, etc.

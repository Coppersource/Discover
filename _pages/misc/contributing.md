Having trouble understanding something? Found a typo in the content? Interested in adding information or helping to [clarify a section](https://gitlab.com/{{ site.repository }}/issues)? Please [submit an issue](https://gitlab.com/{{ site.repository }}/issues) or [merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-merge-request.html). If this is your first merge request, it may be helpful to read up on the [Git Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) first.

Copperforge Discover has been designed as an all-encompassing resource for competition and educational robotics, including FIRST teams from all levels of play. Please keep this in mind when requesting features and/or submitting merge requests. All relevent content is welcome, but when in doubt, please ask!

## Content Additions

If you aren't comfortable with the text format (Markdown) that Copperforge Discover uses, or don't know how to use Gitlab, you can still contribute content! You simply need to create a Gitlab account and open an issue at https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/issues with a short description and a link to your content.

## Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a branch off of `master` and give it a meaningful name (e.g. `my-awesome-new-page`) and describe the feature or fix.
3. Open a pull request on GitHub.

All source files for pages can be found in the [`/_pages`](https://gitlab.com/{{ site.repository }}/tree/master/_pages) folder if you'd like to tackle any "low-hanging fruit" like fixing typos, bad grammar, etc.
